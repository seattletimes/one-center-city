There’s no getting around it.

For three more years, your ability to move through downtown Seattle will take a back seat to growth, while road and utility crews block lanes, [private towers](http://www.seattletimes.com/business/amazon/thanks-to-amazon-seattle-is-now-americas-biggest-company-town/) sprout like chia, the convention center expands, and transit capacity lags.

This era from 2018 to 2021 is euphemistically called the “[period of maximum constraint” by transportation planners.](https://onecentercity.blob.core.windows.net/media/Default/MeetingMaterials/Meeting11/OCC_June8_AG_materials.pdf)

You could say the traffic scrum began unofficially this New Year’s week at Pioneer Square, where crews started tearing open three blocks of First Avenue South, to relocate utilities for a future streetcar line.

More people are trying to bus, walk, drive and bike than the streets can handle.

Approximately 60 tower cranes are aloft citywide, and in the central neighborhoods as many as 110 more buildings will be constructed in the near future, often closing lanes and sidewalks.

Just within a block of Denny Way, some 14 towers of 40 stories or higher are planned or underway. The city has approved garage space [to park 12,000 more cars](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/transportation/south-lake-union-pedestrian-fantasy-meets-car-jammed-reality/) in the South Lake Union area.

A project to double the Washington State Convention Center will take a couple road lanes. The Convention Place bus station will close, pushing hundreds of buses per day out of the transit tunnel and onto city streets, while demolition of the Alaskan Way Viaduct forces more traffic into the busy road grid.

But relief in the form of Sound Transit’s light rail tunnel to Northgate, and a huge order of railcars, won’t arrive until 2021, to carry growing numbers of people unable to cross downtown by bus or car.

So transportation agencies are brainstorming ideas to move more people through one of North America most cramped downtowns. More bike lanes, more buses that stop at rail stations, and wider sidewalks are coming. However, car capacity won’t improve, and will even shrink on First Avenue and the Pike-Pine corridor. Curbside parking will be inexorably swept away..

The burden falls on citizens to adapt — to transfer between buses and trains, to drive less, to walk through a maze of contractor barricades — until the dust settles.

Mayor Jenny Durkan said during her campaign that congestion will get worse before it gets better, and pleaded, “It won’t be the mayor’s fault.”

Transportation officials have invented the slogan One Center City, to imply that a unified plan exists to keep you moving. It might just as well be a plea to cooperate, like people rowing a lifeboat in the same direction.
